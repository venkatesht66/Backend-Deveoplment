# Backend-Deveoplment
Applying for Junior Full Stack Developer job

Create a backend where users can register and store their addresses. There must be two tables: User and Address. There will be one to many relationships between users and addresses. We would prefer if you use a relational database to store the information but MongoDB is also acceptable. Please use Node.js with JavaScript or TypeScript. Any other language will not be considered. There is no need to create an authentication system for the user (Login, JWT). One simple form submission should be enough to achieve this. On submitting the form user name and address is collected. The name is stored in the user table while the address is stored in the address table. Please share the assignment in form of a zip uploaded to Drive or a GitHub link to repository.
